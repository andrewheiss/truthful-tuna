### 😇🐟: Note on “truthful tuna” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, I used [**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to
generate an [Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-me project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.4.0

codename(seed = "amicable contempt", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "truthful tuna"
```
